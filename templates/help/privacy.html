            When you access {{ brand }} this policy binds you. When you create an identity on

        <h4 class="mt-4">Amendments and updates to this policy</h4>
        <p>
            {{ brand }} may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect regulatory
            requirements or changes in our information collection, use or disclosure practices.
            If this Privacy Policy is changed, the new Effective Date will be noted here.

        <h4 class="mt-4">Third-party websites</h4>
        <p>
            This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party sites accessed via links from {{ brand }}.
            {{ brand }} has no control over what those sites do with information which they collect so it would
            be absurd to claim that {{ brand }} has any responsibility for what those sites do. If you want
            to protect yourself then carefully read through any third-party privacy policies before
            agreeing to their terms or using such third party websites.
        </p>
        <h4 class="mt-4">Submission of personal information</h4>
        <p>
            {{ brand }} is an open platform and is designed to allow you and other Users and Contributors
            to share information in an open and transparent manner. With the exception of the information
            collected automatically, detailed below and which may include personal information, {{ brand }}
            does not generally expect from or intend for you to submit personal or private information.
            Notwithstanding the above, should you submit personal information for any legitimate reason;
            such information will be treated in compliance with legal requirements pertaining to personal
            information which may include legal requirements that the information is made available
            to law enforcement agencies or other third parties.
        </p>
        <h4 class="mt-4">What is personal information?</h4>
        <p>
            Personal information means any information relating to a natural person, who can be identified,
            directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more
            factors specific to his or her physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity.
        </p>
        <h4 class="mt-4">Automatic collection of information</h4>
        <p>
            {{ brand }} automatically collects technical information which is required to create your login.
            This includes information which you supply such as a social network login if you make use of a social
            network login, the email address you supply, the names you supply. This includes automatically
            collected technical information such as your preferred language. {{ brand }} does not require you
            to use your legal names but you must use a valid email address.
        </p>
        <p>
            {{ brand }} receives non-personal information via Google Analytics, Google Analytics Demographics
            and Interest Reporting, such as aggregated data of browser type, language preference, referring sites,
            age, gender, or interests, and the time of each visit.
        </p>
        <h4 class="mt-4">Use of information</h4>
        <p>
            {{ brand }} uses the information collected to enable you and others to work together and share
            information using {{ brand }}, as well as to better understand how visitors use {{ brand }} and,
            where possible, to improve their experience.
        </p>
        <h4 class="mt-4">Access to information by third parties</h4>
        <p>
            Personal information that you choose to make available on the public sections of {{ brand }} can be viewed
            by third party individuals with internet access. The manner in which information available on public pages
            is used by third party individuals falls outside the control of the {{ brand }}. You should carefully consider
            what personal information you elect to make available online through {{ brand }}.
        </p>
        <p>
            {{ brand }} will never sell your personal information to third parties, without your prior consent. {{ brand }}
            may disclose your personal information as required by law when {{ brand }} believes that disclosure is necessary
            to protect our rights, and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or legal process.
        </p>
        <h4 class="mt-4">Google Analytics and opting out</h4>
        <p>

            their experience. If you want to opt-out, there is an add-on for your web browser that you can
