        <p>
            These are the general terms and conditions on which we supply all our services. If you use our services,
            you agree to abide by these terms.
        </p>
        <p>
            We may update these terms and conditions at any time. If we do so, we will announce the change on our blog.
            Any changes will be binding on you from the moment we announce them.
        </p>
        <p>
            This agreement is made under the laws of England and Wales.
        </p>
        <p>
            At {{brand}} we supply a lot of different services. Some of them will have specific terms tailored for them.
            If that is the case, {{brand}}’s contract with you for that service will be on these terms, supplemented
            by any terms specific to the service. In the case of any conflict, service specific terms will take precedence.
        </p>
        <p>
            We process personal data in accordance with our <a href="{{ url_for('help.privacy') }}">Privacy Policy</a>.
            As part of this agreement you consent to our doing so. You should read the policy carefully, especially if
            you have any concerns about your privacy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unless we have agreed a particular level of service with you, we make absolutely no promises about the
            quality or existence of any of our services. Please read the sections below and our general exclusion of liability.
        </p>
        <p>
            All use of our web services are subject to our terms for web users. There are further terms if you have signed up
            for an account with one of our services.
        </p>
        <h4 class="mt-4">Terms for use of our web services</h4>
        <p>
            Web services include our API’s as well as any of our websites.
        </p>
        <p>
            While we are proud of the services we provide to the world for free and try to make them reliable and useful,
            we make no promises about them. All web services are certain to fail some of the time. We adapt and change
            our services from time to time, so you may find that something that previously worked for you may cease to work.
            We may also stop supplying any service, temporarily or permanently or block access to our services to anyone for
            any reason.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are not a law firm and nothing we do is intended to be taken as legal advice. In particular, while we encourage
            the use of one of the <a href="http://okfn.org/licenses/">open data commons licences from the Open Knowledge Foundation</a>
            we cannot give any warranty that they will work in the way expected or should be used for any specific purpose.
            If in doubt, you should take your own legal advice.
        </p>
        <h4 class="mt-4">What you agree</h4>
        <p>
            You agree not to use our websites to do any of the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>anything which is illegal either where you are in the world, or where we are</li>
            <li>cause nuisance to other users of our services</li>
            <li>interfere with the normal running of our services</li>
            <li>
                try to access our systems in a way other than those advertised by us and, in particular, to use a web crawler
                that does not respect the robots exclusion policy.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="mt-4">Other websites</h4>
        <p>
            Some of our activities are carried out on web platforms provided by third parties. For example the source code for our
            projects and plugins are hosted on Github. If you make use of any service where that is the case, you are responsible
            for complying with any terms of service of the third party platform.
        </p>
        <h4 class="mt-4">Accounts</h4>
        <p>
            Some of our services require you to create an account in order to make certain, or any, use of the service.
            All our accounts are subject to the following rules:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>You must be at least 13 years old and a human being.</li>
            <li>You must supply us with a valid e-mail address.</li>
            <li>
                You are responsible for the security of your accounts and making sure that any contact
                details in the account are kept up to date. If we need to contact you but are unable to do so,
                for example because your e-mail address is no longer valid, then any consequences of that failure
                will be your responsibility.
            </li>
            <li>
                You must not let anyone else use your account. If pressure is applied to you to do so — for example if an employer demands
                your username and password — please inform them that their attempt to subvert your agreement with us will mean that they
                have no permission to use any of our services. We may take action, including criminal prosecution, if they use our services
                using an account they have obtained in this way.
            </li>
            <li>You must let us know of any unauthorised use of your account as soon as you are able to after becoming aware of it.</li>
            <li>We may suspend or terminate your account at any time. Equally, you may close your account at any time</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="mt-4">Membership</h4>
        <p>
            Our most important class of account is one <a href="{{ url_for('account.signin') }}">you may create</a> in order to become a member.
            By registering as a member, you are acknowledging your connection to us. You are subject to any rules for community members we may
            publish and we may send you email messages we think appropriate for members, for example in order to poll you on some important issue.
        </p>
        <p>
            Membership is not membership in the formal sense of membership of a company limited by guarantee.
        </p>
        <h4 class="mt-4">Content and intellectual property</h2>
        <p>
            If you contribute content to any of our services, for example by commenting on a task, or uploading data, then as a general rule you
            agree to licence that content to us under the same licence as prevails for that service or website.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unless otherwise stated all our services are offered under open content or data licences and you should refer to the provisions of the licence
            in question to find out what you are allowed to do. Some of our content belongs to third parties. Most third party data is subject to an open licence,
            but we cannot guarantee it. You should refer to the third party if you are in doubt.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a general rule, this agreement will not change the ownership of any intellectual property belonging to either party. Where your content is used
            by us or vice versa both you and we would do so under a licence (see above).
        </p>
        <h4 class="mt-4">Liability</h4>
        <p>
            If you breach any of your obligations under this agreement and, as a result, cause us to be sued by anyone else, you will have to compensate us for
            any loss we have suffered as a result, which includes any costs, such as paying lawyers, or for our own time, we incur defending a claim as well
            as any damages awarded. If your breach causes you to be sued by someone else, you will not sue us for any loss you suffer as a result.
        </p>
        <p>
            We limit our liability in several different ways — all of which we believe to be fair. In case any one of them is found to be unenforceable by a
            court, each of the following limitations of liability is separate and our liability to you is limited by all of them:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                All exclusions of liability are only in so far as we are allowed to do so by whatever law applies to the situation. For example, the law of
                England and Wales prevents us from excluding our liability for any personal injury or death caused by our negligence. We do not exclude such liability.
            </li>
            <li>We will not be liable for any damage that was not reasonably foreseeable at the time we made this agreement.</li>
            <li>We are not liable for any loss which is indirect or consequential. That includes any loss of business or profit.</li>
            <li>We exclude, in so far as we are allowed, any warranties that would be implied by law.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="mt-4">Boilerplate</h4>
        <p>
            These final “boilerplate” terms of should go without saying, but we are saying them anyway just to be clear.
        </p>
        <p>
            If any part of this agreement is ineffective (for example because it is unlawful) then the rest of the agreement should be read without it.
        </p>
        <p>
            This agreement is between you and us and is not intended to give anyone else any rights.
        </p>
        <p>
            We may sometimes fail to enforce our rights under this agreement (for example because we decide not to, or we did not realise you were in breach of contract).
            Just because we have not enforced any of our rights, does not stop us from doing so in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            Neither party is liable for anything which is beyond their reasonable control.
        </p>
